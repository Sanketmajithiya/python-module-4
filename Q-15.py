# Q.15 When will the else part of try-except-else be executed? 
"""In Python, the else block in a try-except statement is executed when no exception occurs in the try block. 
If an exception occurs, the except block is executed, and the else block is skipped.
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # Code to handle the exception
else:
    # Code to execute if no exception occurs
